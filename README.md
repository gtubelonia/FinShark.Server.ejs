this is an express.js backend I created for Finshark.
the original backend was in .NET with a mssql database from Teddy Smith's youtube course.

this uses mongo db for the backend.

ideas?:

add some kind of sorting to the portfolio section.
maybe paginate it.
group stocks by industry/sector?
maybe sort stocks within groups by price?
